* IO
** some function take long time just wait for result with no computation
** (lib) make it async to allow next line execute without wait
** to get result, use
*** callback
*** promise

** if have =promise= can use =await= to unwrap
** if use =await=, function need to be =async=
** ==async== function always wrap return in ==promise==
