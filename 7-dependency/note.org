* dependency
** function
in A() call B()
A -> B

B change = A change
A change = B nothing
use A = have B
use B = nothing with A
write A = wait B
write B = nothing

same as A -> B -> C

more you depend, more headache

#+begin_src js
const B = (x, y) => x + y

const A = (x, y) => `answer: ${B(x, y)}`
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: undefined

** file / module
recompile

** component
BE/FE

FE -> BE
re deploy

** logic

* application
Input -> Logic -> Output
